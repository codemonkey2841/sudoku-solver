# sudoku-solver
I was sitting at home over Christmas break, listening to my grandmother talk about how much she enjoyed doing sudoku puzzles,
but she couldn't finish them sometimes so she would leave them for my mother to finish up.  It got me wondering how easy it would
be to write a sudoku solver.

I wrote this solver using the pen and paper algorithms I use myself to solve sudoku puzzles, so it probably isn't the most efficient
solver known to man.

## Expected Input
The puzzle should be input as 9 lines containing 9 characters each.  Use "." for empty spaces.  For example:

```
3.8.2.9.6
47..9.2..
..9..4...
......4.9
5..9.6..7
7.4......
...3..1..
..7.5..24
2.3.8.6.5
```

## Output
The solved puzzle will be output in the same format as the input (hopefully without blank cells).
